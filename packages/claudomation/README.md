# Claudomation

Claudomation is a CLI wrapper around Claude + MCP.

It exists to help bridge the gap between "I want to build something with Claude"
and "Claude is running fully autonomously on a server somewhere".

This plays out in the several "modes" of Claudomation:

## Interactive TUI

Initially, Claudomation is a fully-fledged, interactive TUI.

This mode is meant to help _build trust_.

- Trust in your tooling
- Trust in your runbook
- Trust in Claude

## Other modes

(That's the only mode for now)
